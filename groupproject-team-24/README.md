# Game Design

## Story:
Nate Hunter was a highly skilled member of the Canadian Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). During a mission overseas, he was the only survivor of an ambush by a terrorist group and was badly injured. He was transported back to Canada in a coma, where he remained for several years.

When Nate finally woke up, he found himself in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. With no memory of how the world had become overrun by the undead, he set out with one goal: SURVIVE.

## Visuals:
This game will be in the “8-bit” style, the character wakes up in his military base hospital and then will progress to an open room where he will have to survive as long as he can.

The character will get to customise the character through found loot such as armour, and weapons.

## Rules/Gameplay:
Survive as long as possible by avoiding or defeating zombies.

Collect resources such as weapons, armour, and medical supplies to help you stay alive.

Upgrade your equipment over time to become a more effective survivor.

Choose your battles wisely and conserve your resources when possible.

Keep a close eye on your health, armour, ammo, and other vital stats to ensure your survival.

Enjoy the immersive and challenging gameplay experience of a classic 8-bit arcade-style zombie survival game.

## Stages:

## Stage 1 - Adventure/Looting:
In this stage, Nate awakens in the hospital. The gameplay in this stage is focused on exploration and survival, with a heavy emphasis on looting for supplies. Nate will encounter different types of zombies, and he will need to use his combat skills and ingenuity to overcome them.

## Stage 2 - Defence:
Once Nate completes the first level, the gameplay changes to a last-stand driven style. Nate will be tasked with surviving against a massive zombie horde. The gameplay in this stage is focused on strategy and survival, with a heavy emphasis on lasting as long as possible. Nate will need to use his skills and resources to hold out as long as possible. The final stand will require Nate to use all of the tools and weapons he has collected throughout the game, and to make strategic decisions about how best to defend his home and loved ones.

Overall, the game will provide a unique gameplay experience that combines elements of exploration, survival, and strategy. The two distinct stages will offer players different challenges and gameplay mechanics, ensuring that the game remains engaging and exciting from start to finish.
